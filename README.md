[00:24.61] Don't you know I love you?
[00:30.29] Don't you know I love you?
[00:36.10] Don't you know I love you?
[00:41.85] Don't you know I love you?
[00:50.38] Something in the water
[00:52.74] Told me I should stay away
[01:01.99] Shining in the rough
[01:04.09] They dig us up and separate
[01:08.65] What a waste
[01:12.23] Caught up in a trap, the world was in the back
[01:14.67] If you were only just a scab
[01:16.29] I wouldn't be looking back, you know
[01:20.52] You know
[01:23.77] Light up in the cab, the world is only mad
[01:26.34] That time is moving fast
[01:27.84] And it won't be in a trance for long
[01:32.10] For long
[01:33.90] Don't you know I love you?
[01:39.74] Don't you know I love you?
[01:45.54] Don't you know I love you?
[01:51.22] Don't you know I love you?
[01:58.38] Caught up in a trap, the world was in the back
[02:00.93] If you were only just a scab
[02:02.50] I wouldn't be looking back, you know
[02:06.78] You know
[02:10.05] Light up in the cab, the world is only mad
[02:12.62] That time is moving fast
[02:14.10] And it won't be in a trance for long
[02:18.37] For long
